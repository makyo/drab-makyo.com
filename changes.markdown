title: On Changes

---

If you've found yourself here, there's a good chance you're wondering about a
few basic changes in my life.  Perhaps you knew me well previously, perhaps you
found this page searching for the name I used to go by, Matthew.  This page is
in place to help explain these changes, what they mean for me, and what they
mean for those in my life.

I am a transgender person.  Specifically, I identify as genderqueer.  Although I
was assigned male at birth, I do not strongly identify with that gender at all,
and find that I feel most comfortable in a neutral, leaning feminine role.
There are certain things that I can do to make my way through life be more
comfortable and I am working on taking these steps so that I can be the best
person I know how to be.  Through the summer and fall of 2014, I worked on
shedding the name of Matthew Joseph Scott and adopting the name Madison Jesse
Scott-Clary, and adopting gender-neutral or feminine pronouns for myself
(she/her or they/them, specifically).  Each of these steps will be, to the best
of my ability, deliberate and explicit.

If you have any questions on this change, please feel free to get in touch with
me and ask away.  I have left this page deliberately short rather than try and
answer any questions ahead of time.  I love answering questions about this
topic, and will gladly discuss at whatever length with anyone in order to make
sure everyone is comfortable with this and future transitions.

If you need any additional resources, I've compiled a short list:

* [A good set of pages on transgender and gender variance
  issues](http://transwhat.org/)
* [A well-written video on non-binary gender, sexuality, and
  presentation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAGYQtk3r4)
* [A friend, who is going through similar changes in their life, wrote a really
  good analogy on binaries and
  identities](https://medium.com/@indilatrani/early-birds-and-night-owls-afc59712b0b8)
* [A really good paper on the types of things I've been working through over the
  past decade or so](http://web.uvic.ca/~ahdevor/Witnessing.pdf)
