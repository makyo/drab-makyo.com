The following is my last will and testament. I have no real plans on dying anytime soon, despite what depression may have be believe, but as I have a major surgery coming up and lots of anxiety, it seemed prudent. Here is a plaintext copy, but this copy is not to be considered valid. See below for the signed version.

<div class="will">
{% capture will %}{% include_relative will.md %}{% endcapture %}
{{will|markdownify}}
</div>

[Signed Will](signed-will.md.asc) --- only this signed copy shall be considered valid.
