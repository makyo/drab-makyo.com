\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Beneficiaries and friends at the discretion of The Polycule\footnote{https://makyo.io/maddycule - view pass: Maddy} may keep \emph{no more than three items each} as mementos under the following terms:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This does not include laptops (see \emph{article 3, section 3} below).
  \item
    Items may be grouped sensibly (e.g: a camera body and its lenses in a camera bag).
  \item
    All three items must be able to be carried at once.
  \item
    This does not include shared items (e.g: art, furniture, etc).
  \item
    On that note, pieces of art do not count toward the ``three each'' clause, but The Polycule gets first pick.
  \item
    Yes, James, this means you too. You have two estates already in the house.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \emph{All} remaining physical assets are to be sold, donated, or disposed of responsibly.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}

  \item
    All funds from sold assets are to be treated as liquid assets under \emph{article 3, section 6}.
  \item
    Beneficiaries may not receive any remaining physical assets through sale, donation, or disposal. Please, James, get rid of my stuff for real.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  To the following, above and beyond the ``three each'' clause:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    To The Polycule: if you have given me a proxy, you may have it back with my blessing.
  \item
    To James Clary (Everett, WA): all my toys and gear, so that you may keep having fun.
  \item
    To Robin Reed (Redwood City, CA): all my music on physical media. All CDs, vinyl, and the one cassette tape I own, plus any sheet music you may want. You became the musical connection in my life.
  \item
    To Judith (Conor McKeown) (London, UK): every single corgi-themed thing I owned. You're my number one best corgi, after all, even when you're not a corgi.
  \item
    To Colton-Reye (pseudonym; somewhere in KY; point of contact: Polycule Chat): all my Magic: The Gathering cards, as we got back into it together.
  \item
    To Justin Coffman (Apex, NC); point of contact: Telegram {[}@Whislock{]}(https://t.me/Whislock)): my collar.
  \item
    To @KsenoFox@twitter.com (somewhere in TX; point of contact: Judith): my hard-bound, gold-trimmed copy of \emph{Dune}, in the hopes that it keeps giving you strange and wonderful thoughts about the bene geserit.
  \item
    To Paul Rapoport (Chicago, IL; point of contact: Telegram {[}@coronacoreanici{]}(https://t.me/coronacoreanici)): my copy of \emph{S}. Perhaps the story will be even more complete if you have two of them.
  \item
    To Kevin Frane (San Jose, CA; point of contact: Telegram {[}@rikoshi{]}(https://t.me/rikoshi)): my two pieces of brush calligraphy wall art. One is a blessing for your home, and the other a poem.
  \item
    To Alex Osaki (Berlin, Germany; point of contact: Telegram {[}@DETXL{]}(https://t.me/DETXL)): my BitBucket account, which hosts raw dumps of all Furry Survey data, for you to do with what you please, and my everlasting gratitude for your trust.
  \item
    To members of The Fellowship of the Phoenix (Seattle, WA): my wand, knife, and Fellowship materials, to deconsecrate and destroy, bury, or keep. In payment for this and the joy you brought me, you're also welcome to my stock of Christmas Mead.

  Any attempt to memorialize me under my deadname \emph{will} result in haunting. It won't be pleasant: I know how to be loud if need be. Don't do it.
\item
  While I largely consider myself of the mindset that ``I'm dead, so I won't care; do what you want'', I realize that me being dead doesn't mean that \emph{other} people won't care. Most of the stuff I have specified in here isn't due to me wanting anything in particular done with my remains/assets/what-have-you, but more to do with my respect for those in my life. The big exception being what's done with my remains, my one indulgence. If something isn't specified above, then do what you want. I'm dead, so I won't care.
\item
  This will is public, and maybe shared as needed.
