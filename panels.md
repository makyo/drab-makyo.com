title: Convention and Conference Panels
---

As I attend more and more conventions and conferences, I've started accruing ideas for panels, and now have several prepared panels, as well as a list of topics I know about and would be willing to present.

### Prepared panels

Safer sex is important for staying healthy, both physically and emotionally. Join Makyo from Love - Sex - Fur in exploring ways to enjoy intimacy safely.

Healthy Relationships in Furry

Gender and Furry
:   Both gender and furry touch on very important aspects of identity, and the fandom often provides a space in which to explore one's gender in a safe manner. Join Makyo from Love - Sex - Fur to talk about what gender is and how it interacts with the furry subculture.

### Presentation topics

Social --- Furry
:   Furry is a subculture focused on the appreciation of and identification with anthropomorphized animals. I have been working with and studying furry since 2011, and have considered myself a part of the subculture since 2000. Over this time, I have amassed tens of thousands of results from a dozen or so surveys, and have been writing about the data and the experiences of both myself and others through several outlets, published online and in print.
