### *Important Information*

I recently discontinued the medication olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, at 1.25mg daily, and reduced my fluoxetine intake from 40mg daily to 20mg daily.  As a result, I am going through withdrawal symptoms, which range from mild irritability and sleeplessness to black outs/memory loss and, on Sept. 26th, a collapse, exacerbated by dehydration.  If I suddenly become lethargic, have a hard time standing, lose coherence, appear to get super depressed, or, heaven forbid, collapse again, please feel free to take me to urgent care or the ER and show them this page, available at drab-makyo.com/911  Also, get me a glass of water, since that seems to be a trigger.

Additionally, although less pressing, the withdrawal sends me occasionally into mixed affective states which appear primarily as agitation and pacing, with difficulty concentrating and, at worst, a motor tic in my neck.  This is *not urgent*, just help me calm down.  Also, get me a glass of water, just to be safe :)

I also quit drinking, so some withdrawal symptoms may be related to that.
