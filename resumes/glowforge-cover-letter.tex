\begin{verse}
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May--\\
\vin Too trite? Old fashioned? I can see that, sure.\\
With Glowforge --- work that feels like play ---\\
\vin some iambs might just be a bit obscure.\\
With copy, Shakespeare's just too stuffy. Sigh.\\
\vin If only there was something just as cool,\\
a quippy style to use when I apply,\\
\vin my cover letter shining in the pool.\\
But what if I could keep the sonnet form?\\
\vin Some poetry to differentiate?\\
I hope exploring text outside the norm\\
\vin perhaps will catch your eye and captivate.\\
\vin \vin With tech experience to go with text,\\
\vin \vin I'd love to be your copy writer next.
\end{verse}

Okay, so perhaps it's still a bit trite.

That said, I was enamored with your job posting, just as I've been enamored with all of the delightful things I've seen come from Glowforge. It has a clear sense of style that still conveys the necessary information to the applicant, making them want to work there all the more.

One of my goals when writing copy is a consistent, friendly style that provides clear information to the reader so that they can pick up on what the text is offering without feeling alienated. I've strived to maintain this in my communications, posts, and advertisements throughout my experience.

I believe that my knowledge and experience both in the writing and technical fields would be a great asset in a copy writing position such as this. My background allows me to quickly gain knowledge of potentially complex topics and turn out writing on them that is both accurate and enjoyable to read.

As I look to grow my experience and knowledge, I hope you'll consider me as a candidate to help grow Glowforge.
