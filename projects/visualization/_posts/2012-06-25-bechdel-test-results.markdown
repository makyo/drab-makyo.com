[The Bechdel Test](http://vis.mjs-svc.com/bechdel/) is one way to measure what is known as the Male Gaze in cinema. It measures three criteria:

1. There are at least two named female characters...
2. ...who speak with each other...
3. ...about something other than a man.

The website [bechdeltest.com](http://bechdeltest.com) has collected and rated movies across over 100 years of cinema on these three criteria. The data was pulled down, munged with python, and turned into this vis and short write-up.
