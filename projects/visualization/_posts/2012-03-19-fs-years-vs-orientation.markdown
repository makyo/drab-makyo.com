title: Furry Survey - Years in the Fandom vs. Sexual Orientation

---

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/projects/visualization/years-orientation.png" /></div>

I was asked by other members of \[adjective\]\[species\] to come up with a visualization for data correlating the number of years the respondent had been in the fandom with their sexual orientation. This was then used in a post on the subject.  It's available [here](http://vis.adjectivespecies.com/yearsorientation).
