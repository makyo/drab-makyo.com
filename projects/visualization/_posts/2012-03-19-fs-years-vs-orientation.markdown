I was asked by other members of \[adjective\]\[species\] to come up with a visualization for data correlating the number of years the respondent had been in the fandom with their sexual orientation. This was then used in a post on the subject.  It's available [here](http://vis.adjectivespecies.com/yearsorientation).
