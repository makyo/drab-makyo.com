While my focus in web design has been primarily on data storage and display, I've been thinking a lot about what to do with metadata. This has stemmed from a lot of my daily reading, involving several blogs that talk a lot about data visualization. In order to integrate infographics and visualization into my other projects, I've been working on simple and complex visualizations of ready-to-use datasets, learning a visualization library or two in the process. This site collects the visualizations that I have so far, which are also listed on this website in the visualization tag. I aim for a simple, monochromatic page for each visualization in order to make them all the clearer, and the design carried through to this simple index.  Collected Visualizations is available [here](http://vis.mjs-svc.com)
