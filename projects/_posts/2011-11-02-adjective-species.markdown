\[adjective\]\[species\] was created as a blog to explore the furry fandom from the inside. The website includes the blog itself, as well as forums, surveys, and visualizations of those surveys. The blog is run off WordPress, but includes a custom theme and a commissioned banner, but the survey and visualizations were both created on my own. The site has two regular authors - myself and JM - and a few occasional contributors. It also includes tie-ins with Twitter, Google+, and FurAffinity.net.
