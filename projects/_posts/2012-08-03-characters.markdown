[Characters](http://characters.openfurry.org) is a site intended to manage multiple role-playing characters, with potentially multiple morphs, each of which may potentially have multiple descriptions. Additionally, images may be uploaded and attached to any object in that hierarchy. It is a Django and Backbone.js powered site, with a little help from D3.
