A Full Life is "a small game exploring the ways in which we experience creating a life for ourselves that's just full enough, but not too full."  The goal in the game is to attempt to fill up a life to 100% with activities and goals.  You only have so much life, though and sometimes things just aren't quite that easy.  Just a quick, exploratory project written in JavaScript/D3.  You can play the game [here](http://a-full-life.drab-makyo.com) and check out the source [here](https://github.com/makyo/a-full-life).
