For a long time, it has been my perception that all the information that could be portrayed to a potential employer or client could not be conveyed easily with a simple, one page r&eacute;sum&eacute;. My original way around this involved setting up a portfolio site which I could provide a link to from my r&eacute;sum&eacute;, but this was less than ideal: an update to one required an update to the other, there was no guarantee that the portfolio site would be viewed upon receiving a r&eacute;sum&eacute;, and the separation made it difficult for me to express my skills at first glance. Now, I have combined the two - a visual r&eacute;sum&eacute; that provides all the information of the former with all the expression of the latter incorporating aspects of design and data visualization.  It's available [here](http://resume.drab-makyo.com).
