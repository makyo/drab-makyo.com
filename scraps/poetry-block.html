A rose, single, now blooming
   may indeed bless the stem,
yet are not roses clipp'd and shown?
   Undoubted 'tis a blessing to them
who receive such a gift!
   Yet now unmade is the flow'r
which adorns thy mantle with its grace,
   and withers, however slowly, by the hour
      until 'tis faded to nothing and dust,
      though some scent remain forever amidst the must.
