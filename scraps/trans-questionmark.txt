Can I get some opinions on a trans-in-the-workplace question? I'm asking in a lot of places.

I dunno if I'll have an opinion, but I don't mind the asking in the least. (edited)

So, work laid off a third of all employees across the board, after promising it was just discontinuing one product.

[12:40]
Managers were pulled into one-on-one meetings with the president-now-CEO and asked to go through everyone on their team with him and pick a few to let go. We lost two on our team, and we really can't afford it, but that's only ancillary.

[12:41]
When they came to me, my boss mentioned that my performance was lacking, but he thought that was because HRT was causing drastic swings in productivity.

[12:41]
It's really because a) bipolar's a bitch, and b) I kind of hate the tasks I get.

Zoe Landon [12:41 PM]
stop being me, dammit.

[12:42]
(I kid. continue.)

Makyo [12:42 PM]
Anyway, CEO jumped on it and said it was super interesting and that I should be kept and supported and asked a whole bunch of questions about HRT and so on.

I feel kind of like I was kept on as a token for diversity purposes. I'm _super_ uncomfortable with that, but I'm wondering: am I reading into that too much? Like, my performance is objectively worse than it used to be because of the problems above, but I feel really iffy about that being placed on HRT.

Ryan Campbell [12:45 PM]
Look at it this way, Makyo. Whatever you  blame those problems on, HRT is not making your OVERALL life easier. If you're dealing with complications from that, it means you have less mental/emotional energy to handle with grace/professionalism a) bipolarity, and b) tasks you hate

[12:46]
You're having a tough time and it should be okay to accept help even if the help you're accepting is not directly related to what you're suffering from.

It's possible you are being kept on because of that, but I always advise anyone upset about their job to first look for another job and find one before they quit. If you don't feel welcome anymore, exit gracefully. Also, the company just went through a big layoff, and many people are I am sure stressed about that.

If you're conflicted about the token for diversity issue Sara Ahmed has a book "On Being Included: Racism and Diversity in Institutional Life" and probably has related posts on her blog. Could be helpful, she's also a great scholar.

Zoe Landon [12:52 PM]
I have definitely felt like I’ve been kept on (or praised, or whatever) for diversity purposes. hell, my “diversity value” was called out at the job I had when I first transitioned. at the same time, I _definitely_ have experienced cases where less-capable devs have gotten equal or even higher praise. so there’s a mix-in of imposter syndrome too.

also: it’s easy to read malicious (or at least negative) intent into well-meaning behavior when it comes to trans stuff, because most people still aren’t very well educated about us. it’s also easy to excuse bad behavior for the same reason. if you want to put forth the effort on educating people, you can do that, but it’s a lot of emotional labor.

so I’d agree that it’s best to get out of the situation entirely, if you can. if you can’t, I’d be more forthcoming with your manager about the bipolar stuff, so that you have an explanation that takes the focus away from being trans. (unless, of course, you fear that them knowing you’re bipolar would be worse.)

I’d also say that, if your performance really was that bad, they would’ve booted you anyway. so maybe you’re not the best on the team (and the women on a team will almost _never_ be seen as the best, even if we are), but you’re good enough to keep around.

James Bell [12:54 PM]
I think there's no doubt that the fact you're on HRT played a role in that decision. But I don't think it's a negative thing. You're part of a minority, and the nature of your particular minority status means that there is an _actual physical impact on how you function_ (namely, hormone things). It may be that HR is keeping you on as a token, but I think it's more likely that they're keeping you on because they recognize you have a temporary physical handicap, and that with proper handling, you'll be as productive as you were before.

Zoe Landon [12:54 PM]
(the only effect I remember HRT having on my performance was that I was pretty tired the first few weeks, but then I’m far from the best judge of my work capacity)

[12:56]
I also got really tired when I started anti-depressants, though that was longer (like a month or two)

Miriam "Camio" Curzon [1:00 PM]
If this helps, my professor/department career coach suggests using every advantage they grant you. And while the idea of being a token of diversity is problematic and not fun, recognizing it and using it to further your own (assumably diverse) agenda is fine. As far as I am concerned, there are enough places that won't hire some because of who they are or might be, so might as well benefit from one of the places willing to do the opposite. Token diversity also only works in a capitalist economy when the benefits are net positive, so I think at worst it might be a deciding factor between you and someone of equal productivity. If that makes sense. Writing on iPad in sun with sunglasses while roasting and probably getting a sunburn isn't too fun.
