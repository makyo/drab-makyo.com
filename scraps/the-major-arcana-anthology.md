### Full log

    A major arcana anthology would be _so neat_.

    searska	[5:38 PM]  
    ^^^

    Makyo	[5:39 PM]  
    The majors already tell a cyclical story, so it'd be good to see that put into (incredibly furry) words.

    Gnarl Graymuzzle	[5:39 PM]  
    Arcane? are you talking about me?

    Makyo	[5:39 PM]  
    ._.

    [5:39]  
    Perhaps a little too excited, heh.

    searska	[5:41 PM]  
    scribbles a note to do a Tarot themed story, just in case. ;)

    Kyell Gold	[5:42 PM]  
    Just start an anthology, Makyo. :slightly_smiling_face:

    Makyo	[5:42 PM]  
    I can _do_ that?

    ryffnah	[5:42 PM]  
    A Tarot themed anthology does seem like a good idea

    Makyo	[5:42 PM]  
    Do I just get in touch with a publisher or something?

    Thurston Howl	[5:42 PM]  
    It's been really fun as a formatting theme. I'm sure it would work well as a general anthology too!

    Kyell Gold	[5:43 PM]  
    That’d be a good first step. :slightly_smiling_face: Or you could put out a call to writers who might be interested and then you could go to a publisher and say “I have X and Y and Z authors interested in contributing to this anthology, would you like to publish it?"

    Makyo	[5:44 PM]  
    Oooh, alright!

    Makyo	[5:44 PM]  
    scribbles notes!

    searska	[5:44 PM]  
    Whoohoo! :D

    Kyell Gold	[5:45 PM]  
    I’d be interested to hear your writeup for it.

    Gnarl Graymuzzle	[5:45 PM]  
    Tarot huh, I might even get into that one.

    Makyo	[5:45 PM]  
    wag ^^

    Thurston Howl	[5:46 PM]  
    It'd be a pretty diverse collection, genre-wise too probably.

    Makyo	[5:46 PM]  
    Mmhm.

    ryffnah	[5:46 PM]  
    ::decides this is a good enough excuse to order the Tarot deck on her wishlist and orders it::

    Kyell Gold	[5:46 PM]  
    It’d depend on how Makyo wants to theme it.

    [5:46]  
    Could give it more consistency of genre or leave it wide open.

    Thurston Howl	[5:47 PM]  
    Well, if it was themed around the Arcana as was suggested earlier, I would imagine subs being versatile...in theory.

    [5:47]  
    But you're right: if the genre was set from the beginning, it'd be pretty strong too.

    Makyo	[5:47 PM]  
    22 stories, hmm.

    [5:47]  
    Could create loose restrictions, like "within 100 years - past or future - of present day" or something?

    ryffnah	[5:48 PM]  
    ::confused by that restriction::

    Makyo	[5:48 PM]  
    I dunno!  Just trying to think of ways to add cohesion.  It was just an example ^^; (edited)

    ryffnah	[5:48 PM]  
    My stories and worlds don't necessarily relate to the present day in any useful way.

    searska	[5:49 PM]  
    Huh. Alien tarot. *ponders this*

    Kyell Gold	[5:49 PM]  
    Personally I like having something to connect the stories more than an aesthetic… for instance you could place it in a loosely SF universe and say “each story follows the travels of one card of a special deck,” and then you write a framing story that starts with the deck’s cards being scattered.

    ryffnah	[5:49 PM]  
    They're either far, far future or totally parallel universe most of the time.

    Makyo	[5:49 PM]  
    nods, just a suggestion.  Sounds like perhaps a not so good one ^^;

    Kyell Gold	[5:49 PM]  
    But it takes a little more work to make it cohere that much.

    ryffnah	[5:50 PM]  
    Unless they're Secret Life of Animals.

    Makyo	[5:50 PM]  
    nods to Kyell

    Thurston Howl	[5:50 PM]  
    I typically write historical fiction; sci fi boggles my mind.

    ryffnah	[5:50 PM]  
    The more restrictions, the less likely I am to try writing for something. ::shrug::

    Makyo	[5:50 PM]  
    Rrf, okay..

    Makyo	[5:50 PM]  
    will think.

    Kyell Gold	[5:50 PM]  
    Also if you want one story for each card, you probably don’t want completely open subs because then you’ll end up with ten stories for one card and none for three others.

    [5:51]  
    Might be better to do semi-invitation and then accept subs for the remainder.

    [5:51]  
    (Like EVERYONE is going to do Death, right?)

    Gnarl Graymuzzle	[5:51 PM]  
    Now this is getting interesting, one card given to each of the families in an ancient tribe. The families then scatter into the stars in search of a new home.

    searska	[5:51 PM]  
    always loved that there was a tavern in Dragon Age 2 named The Hanged Man.

    Thurston Howl	[5:51 PM]  
    Right. When I did the Seven Deadly Sins, it was hard getting subs for some of the sins.

    ryffnah	[5:51 PM]  
    But then I tend to lean towards free-form. You can see that in just how tightly themed my volumes of ROAR are. (Spoiler: they aren't.)

    Thurston Howl	[5:51 PM]  
    I had to extend one of their deadlines even.

    [5:52]  
    I can't imagine doing open subs for 22 categories.

    ryffnah	[5:52 PM]  
    I wouldn't pick death to write about.

    Gnarl Graymuzzle	[5:53 PM]  
    Isn't there one called the fool? I would take that one.

    searska	[5:54 PM]  
    I can totally tackle the Death card or the Devil card. ^_^

    Wikipedia
    Major Arcana
    The Major Arcana or trumps are a suit of twenty-two cards in the 78-card Tarot deck. They serve as a permanent trump and suits in games played with the Tarot deck, and are distinguished from the four standard suits collectively known as the Minor Arcana. The terms "Major" and "Minor Arcana" are used in the occult and divinatory applications of the deck, and originate with Jean-Baptiste Pitois, writing under the name Paul Christian.
    Dummett writes that originally the Major Arcana had simple allegorical Show more...

    Kyell Gold	[5:55 PM]  
    See, I’d want to write one of the cards that nobody ever talks about.

    searska	[5:55 PM]  
    List, in case anyone needs it. ^_^

    Kyell Gold	[5:55 PM]  
    When we did our Ten Commandments antho I ended up with “Thou Shalt Honor the Sabbath Day and Keep It Holy."

    Thurston Howl	[5:56 PM]  
    I'd probably do the Hierophant or the Empress personally.

    searska	[5:56 PM]  
    Justice might also be a fun one.

    Harry	[5:56 PM]  
    John Fowles already covered The Magus

    Makyo	[5:56 PM]  
    just captures log.  This is all so *cool*.

    Kyell Gold	[5:56 PM]  
    I’d take Temperance. :smile:

    Thurston Howl	[5:56 PM]  
    Yeah, Kyell, in lieu of the Seven Deadly Sins, two authors have asked me to follow up with Seven Virtues, but I keep telling people we already have the Ten Commandments collection!

    Kyell Gold	[5:58 PM]  
    "Temperance is a card about balance, in many ways, and relationships of all kinds. Friendships, family, romantic partnerships, and work partnerships all need your attention. This is also a card about alchemy or mixing and matching. You may have to try several approaches to things before you find what is truly right for you."

    [5:58]  
    I would SO take that card.

    [5:58]  
    I like stories about people trying several approaches to things. >.>

    Makyo	[5:59 PM]  
    What would be a good length for submissions?

    [5:59]  
    Given that there will be 22? (edited)

    Kyell Gold	[5:59 PM]  
    At 22 stories you probably don’t want them much longer than 5000 words.

    Makyo	[5:59 PM]  
    that's what I was thinking, yeah :S

    Thurston Howl	[5:59 PM]  
    I'd agree.

    [5:59]  
    My minimum is usually like Fred's, 2,000.

    Kyell Gold	[6:00 PM]  
    It’s 5, but we can keep talking here, right Chipotle?

    Harry	[6:01 PM]  
    My Thoth deck is a little different than the classic

    Makyo	[6:01 PM]  
    Yeah, Thoth is kind of its own delightful thing.  It only makes small changes, though, and many are in line with RWS decks.

    [6:01]  
    Well, "small" :stuck_out_tongue:

    Gnarl Graymuzzle	[6:01 PM]  
    I will have to look up Tarot decks, i am sure that there are several different ones?

    Harry	[6:01 PM]  
    I love the artwork. So many little symbols everywhere.

    Kyell Gold	[6:02 PM]  
    There’s a game in France similar to Bridge that uses a tarot deck that I quite enjoyed.

    Harry	[6:02 PM]  
    But yeah Crowley was a lech and a half so #11 Strength is replaced by Lust.

    Makyo	[6:02 PM]  
    Gnarl, check out Universal Waite tarot decks.  Good standard (that's a little easier on the eyes than standard Rider-Waite)

    ryffnah	[6:02 PM]  
    There are tons. I just ordered the Wildwood deck cause it looks like it's pretty.

    Thurston Howl	[6:02 PM]  
    I need a new Tarot deck myself.

    Harry	[6:03 PM]  
    And the entire wands suit is full of sexual imagery.

    Thurston Howl	[6:03 PM]  
    I just searched for Furry Tarot Deck, and this was the first image, from SofaKingGood:

    Makyo	[6:04 PM]  
    Pfffhahahahah

    [6:04]  
    That's great, @thurstonhowlpub ^^

    searska	[6:04 PM]  
    I find it somewhat ironic that, with as much porn as I write, the only tarot deck I have is unicorns. XD

    Makyo	[6:05 PM]  
    The 'furry' one I have is by Tod Wills: https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/tod-s-creatures-tarot

    [6:05]  
    It's _so cute_.

    Thurston Howl	[6:05 PM]  
    Aww.

    Kyell Gold	[6:05 PM]  
    Tod’s stuff is SUPER cute.

    Harry	[6:06 PM]  
    Oh I also own one of Joe Rosales' original Hello Tarot decks

    Chipotle	[6:06 PM]  
    To answer rather belatedly: we can keep talking here, sure. Although I should prompt for our writing/editing goals for the upcoming week.
