title: Duet for Horn and Contrabass - horn, contrabass, percussion - 2009
---

This piece was commissioned by John Gough on horn and David Saccardi on bass. Working with the commissioners to come up with a piece that fit their requirements and tastes led to a piece reminiscent at times of contemporary ambient music, as well as the music of Argentinian tango and Sergei Prokofiev, all while working with two unique instruments.
