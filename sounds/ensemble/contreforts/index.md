title: Contreforts - woodwind quartet - 2008
---

Having grown up at the base of the Rockies, right up against the foothills, I learned to recognize all sorts of different kinds of wind. Little breezes, stormy gales, winds that seemed to move over the landscape in a single laminar sheet. These winds were the inspiration for this piece.
