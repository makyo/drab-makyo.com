title: Summer of Freelancing

## What is this?

I have this idea in my head that, some day, I'll be able to live doing what I really want to do. That's a bit grand, however, so I've scaled it down to this: some day, I'll be able to spend a summer living off the things I really want to do.

If I accomplish more, neat.

If not, that's fine.

For now, though, I'm starting to organize projects that might help me acheive this goal here. Patreon projects, Open Collective projects, simple Gratipay. If I can manage a summer, hopefully the summer of '18, then I'll be happy.
